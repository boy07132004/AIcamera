# RTSP parameters

# Disable support for the RTSP protocol.
rtspDisable: no
# List of enabled RTSP transport protocols.
# UDP is the most performant, but doesn't work when there's a NAT/firewall between
# server and clients, and doesn't support encryption.
# UDP-multicast allows to save bandwidth when clients are all in the same LAN.
# TCP is the most versatile, and does support encryption.
# The handshake is always performed with TCP.
protocols: [udp, multicast, tcp]
# Encrypt handshakes and TCP streams with TLS (RTSPS).
# Available values are "no", "strict", "optional".
encryption: "no"
# Address of the TCP/RTSP listener. This is needed only when encryption is "no" or "optional".
rtspAddress: :8554
# Address of the TCP/TLS/RTSPS listener. This is needed only when encryption is "strict" or "optional".
rtspsAddress: :8322
# Address of the UDP/RTP listener. This is needed only when "udp" is in protocols.
rtpAddress: :8000
# Address of the UDP/RTCP listener. This is needed only when "udp" is in protocols.
rtcpAddress: :8001
# IP range of all UDP-multicast listeners. This is needed only when "multicast" is in protocols.

# Path parameters

# These settings are path-dependent, and the map key is the name of the path.
# It's possible to use regular expressions by using a tilde as prefix.
# For example, "~^(test1|test2)$" will match both "test1" and "test2".
# For example, "~^prefix" will match all paths that start with "prefix".
# The settings under the path "all" are applied to all paths that do not match
# another entry.
paths:
  all:
    source: publisher

    # If the source is an RTSP or RTSPS URL, this is the protocol that will be used to
    # pull the stream. available values are "automatic", "udp", "multicast", "tcp".
    sourceProtocol: automatic


    # If the source is "publisher" and a client is publishing, do not allow another
    # client to disconnect the former and publish in its place.
    disablePublisherOverride: no

    # If the source is "publisher" and no one is publishing, redirect readers to this
    # path. It can be can be a relative path  (i.e. /otherstream) or an absolute RTSP URL.
    fallback:

    # Command to run when this path is initialized.
    # This can be used to publish a stream and keep it always opened.
    # This is terminated with SIGINT when the program closes.
    # The following environment variables are available:
    # * RTSP_PATH: path name
    # * RTSP_PORT: server port
    # * G1, G2, ...: regular expression groups, if path name is
    #   a regular expression.
    # Restart the command if it exits suddenly.
